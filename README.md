# National Parkfinder

## Abstract

This project won 1st Place at the Turing School of Software and Design's all-school Demo Competition. The presentation video for it can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYZMqm7vZA0).

National Parkfinder is an application that allows you to explore all 63 of the national parks in the United States in one place. We implemented the National Parks Service API ([view documentation](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm)) to display each park and were able to access the unique data by calling the API with a four-digit `parkCode` when the user clicks on a button from the navigation menu. Users can search for parks by full or partial name or select a state from the dropdown form. Within the park view, the user can see park details, a map, and contact information about that park. On the displayed park, the user also has the ability to "add to visited" or "add to bucket list". There are separate views for the user's visited and bucket list parks, which can be accessed via the buttons in the footer. From here, they are able to delete them from their respective list or move bucket list parks to their visited list. This app was completed for the Mod3 Stretch project at the Turing School of Software and Design and the full project rubric/spec can be seen [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/stretch.html).
